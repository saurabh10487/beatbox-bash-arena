# Sound Files Directory

This directory should contain the following sound files:
- kick.mp3
- snare.mp3
- hihat.mp3
- clap.mp3
- bass.mp3
- vocal.mp3
- scratch.mp3
- rimshot.mp3

Currently, we're using programmatically generated sounds through the Web Audio API
as a fallback since the actual sound files aren't available.

To use real sound files, place MP3 files with these names in this directory.
